The introduction to Python workshop that took place on the 30th of November, organized and taught by João Mota with the assistance of Diogo Silva, served as a mostly hand-on introduction to the widely used programming language.

The room was, as usual, filled to capacity and, thanks to the experience gained in a previous workshop, João was able to provide a more dynamic approach to the nature of the workshop, which resulted in a fast understanding of the material. This also contributed to a much lighter atmosphere, where participants were keen on participating more frequently. Also, the exercises at the end were easily solved by the participants once they had grasped the more challenging concepts.

Overall, the workshop was deemed a success.
