With this event we hosted a local Hub for the Hash Codeâ€™s 2018 Qualification Round. This was made as a partnership between us, a local Informatics student group (NIAEFEUP) and a nearby IEEE Student Branch (IEEEinISEP).

Food and beverages were provided to the participants as well as a great environment for cooperation while competing and for socializing.
