The IEEEXtreme, a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members, advised and proctored by an IEEE member, competed in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems.

As usual, the UP teams didn’t falter and were well ranked in the national side. But unlike previous years, this year’s proposed problems were all in the hard category, and that reflected heavily on the time and resource management the teams had to do to not let unsolved exercises accumulate early on. But when the UP teams managed to complete a problem, joy was at its highest and a moment of relief and accomplishment was visible across their faces. 

The competition also worked as a way of bonding between older and newer members of the student branch, and everyone had a great time.
