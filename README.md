# nuieee-website [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nuieee/nuieee-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nuieee/nuieee-website)
IEEE UP Student Branch website
## Local Build
To preview the website locally, you must have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed. Just run `jekyll build` or `jekyll serve` depending on your purpose. Basic usage can be seen [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).
## Automatic Deploy
After any commit a build is done in a [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) virtual machine and sent to our hosting at FEUP. Username and password for the hosting account are encrypted and stored in the [repository settings](https://travis-ci.org/nuieee/nuieee-website/settings). The ExCom must update these values when changed, as they are the ones with access to them.
